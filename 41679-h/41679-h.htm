<h2>NAUGHTY NASNA.</h2>


<div class="figright" style="width: 265px;">
<img src="images/illus010-racoon.jpg" width="265" height="400" alt="Nasna on chair beside stove" />
</div>

<p><span class='smcap'>Nasna</span> was a coati-mondi, a cousin of the raccoon family. She was
about the size of a cat, with thick, coarse fur, brown on the back and
sides, and shading from yellow to
orange underneath. She had a head
and four legs, and a fat body; but
the two most important parts of
her, in her own opinion at
least, were her nose and her
tail. The tail was certainly
very handsome, long, and
bushy, with black and yellow
rings round it. The
nose was long, too,&mdash;long
and sharp, and always
poking, poking itself
everywhere. There
never was such an inquisitive
nose. Now it
was lifting the lid of a pot
on the kitchen fire (for Nasna
was tame, and a great pet of
her master's), and scalding itself
with the steam; now it was
sniffing at a bottle of strong ammonia,
without seeming to be troubled
in the least by the smell; now it
was in her master's pocket, trying to find
out what it was that went "Tick! tick!"</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[261]</a></span></p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 500px;">
<img src="images/illus011a.jpg" width="500" height="279" alt="Nasna and Cat" />
</div>

<p>But what do you think the nose did one day? oh! <em>what</em> do you
think it did? You never could guess, and so I must tell you.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 500px;">
<img src="images/illus011b.jpg" width="500" height="232" alt="Nasna and cat fighting" />
</div>

<p>The old cat had been asleep beside the kitchen fire. She had had
a long, long nap,&mdash;the sleepy old cat,&mdash;and when she woke up she felt
that she needed a long, long stretch before she was quite herself again.
Now, the way in which the old cat stretched herself was this: she put
her four feet close together, and humped her back just as high as she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[262]</a></span>
could possibly hump it; then she stretched herself, and opened her
mouth to its fullest extent, and said, "Mu-aw-yu-aouw!"</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 500px;">
<img src="images/illus012a.jpg" width="500" height="138" alt="Nasna on a leash reaching for egg" />
</div>

<p>This was a singular performance. Nasna had never seen it before,
and when she saw the red mouth open, wide, wider, widest, she immediately
said to herself, "Dear me! how very odd! I wonder what
there is inside that red cavern? I'm going to look!" and the next
moment the long, velvety nose was poked right into the old cat's
mouth, and almost down her throat.</p>

<p>Did the old cat shut her mouth? She did, indeed, my child; and
who can blame her for doing so? But there was a sound of woe in the
air, and a squealing as of a coati in despair, and the next moment
Nasna was crouching in the farthest corner of the room, holding her
wounded nose in both hands, and sneezing
violently.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 375px;">
<img src="images/illus012b.jpg" width="375" height="327" alt="Nasna standing and eating egg" />
</div>

<p>But do not think that this was a lesson to
Nasna; nothing of the kind! The very next
morning she managed to find her way into the
dining-room when the master and mistress
were at breakfast. She climbed up at
once into the mistress' lap, and poked
her nose at the shining coffee-pot.
Ah! it was hot. Pop went the
nose into the cup of coffee that
was steaming beside the mistress'
plate. Oh! that was
hotter.</p>

<p>"I won't stay here any longer, to be treated so!" cried Nasna; and
down she jumped to the floor.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[263]</a></span></p>

<p>Buzz! buzz! what is that by the window? Something small, flying
about, with a black and yellow jacket on. See, now it is crawling on
the floor, and Nasna can catch it. Nasna does catch it, putting her
soft paw on it. Mr. Wasp extends his sting, as the utmost he has to
offer. Nasna squeaks wofully, but does not understand yet, so puts
her nose down instead of her paw. This time there is no doubt about
the matter, and she retires in great anguish to the kitchen.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 450px;">
<img src="images/illus013.jpg" width="450" height="133" alt="Nasna scooting egg with tail" />
</div>

<p>One day as she was playing about, tettered by a string to a chair,
her master took an egg and placed it on the floor, at a very provoking
distance. Nasna could just touch it with one paw, but could not
get hold of it. She tried with fore paws, she tried with hind paws; but
all in vain: she only succeeded in rolling the egg a little further off.
What was to be done? She sat down and looked at the egg long
and thoughtfully. At
last she put her head on
one side and winked:
she had an idea. She
turned her back on the
coveted treasure, and
backed towards it as far as she could. Then she grasped her tail with
one paw, stiffened it and curved the tip almost into a hook, and,
touching the egg with this hook, slowly and cautiously rolled it
round in front of her, till she could reach it with her fore paw. Then,
in triumph and much pride, she sat up on her haunches, cracked the
egg, and sucked it, without spilling a drop. Clever Nasna! I think
she deserved a good breakfast, don't you?</p>

<h2>"CHOW-CHOW."</h2>


<p>"<span class='smcap'>Chow-Chow</span>" was not a pickle, but a chicken, and a real funny
one, too.</p>

<p>I made friends with him when he was no bigger than a robin.
He was an only child; of course his mother had enough to do to
pet and fuss over him. But he would leave her any time when we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[264]</a></span>
called "Chow-Chow." We gave
him this funny name because he
was a great talker. All he said was
"C-h-o-w-C-h-o-w," and then "<em>Chow-Chow-Chow-Chow</em>"
as fast as he could talk.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">
<img src="images/illus014.jpg" width="500" height="383" alt="Girl looking out window at chicken on ledge" />
</div>

<p>His mother was a beautiful buff Shanghai, but he was a long-legged
Brahma, dressed in a speckled black and gray suit. As
the days got chilly, in the fall, it seemed as if he suffered dreadfully
from cold feet. He was always cuddling down in the warm feathers
on his mother's back, even when he was a pretty big fellow.</p>

<p>One day I said, "Come, 'Chow-Chow,' don't trouble your mother.
I'll give you a good warming by the kitchen fire." I carried him into
the kitchen, opened the oven door, and gave his cold feet a good
toasting. Oh, how he enjoyed it! He opened and shut his claws
as he lay on my lap, and <em>chow-chowed</em>, and pecked at the buttons
of my dress.</p>

<p>The next day it was pretty cold, and the first thing I heard
when I went into the kitchen was a tapping at the window-pane.
There was "Chow-Chow" on the window-sill, pecking at the glass,
and holding up one foot, and then the other. He was talking, or
rather scolding, at the top of his voice.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[265]</a></span></p>

<p>I let him in. He went straight to the stove, and waited for
me to take him in my arms and warm his feet. He seemed to
think it was ever so much nicer than his mother's feathers.</p>

<p>One cold morning I was busy when he came in. The stove
was very hot, and "Chow-Chow"&mdash;silly bird!&mdash;couldn't wait for
me to attend to him. He flew up on the top of the stove. Then
he gave a scream, and landed on the table. That was the first
and last time he tried to warm his feet without my help.</p>

<p>My sister always said that "Chow-Chow" was a hen. I felt
sure he was a rooster.
She said, "The first we
know 'Chow-Chow' will
lay an egg." <em>I</em> said,
"The first we know
'Chow-Chow' will <em>crow</em>."</p>

<p>After a while I saw
some bright red whiskers
under his chin. Then
such a pretty coral comb.
Still he only talked
"Chow-Chow-Chow."</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 271px;">
<img src="images/illus015.jpg" width="271" height="400" alt="Chicken on stove" />
</div>

<p>But one morning he
came into the kitchen
in a great hurry. He
jumped upon the table,
flapped his wings, and
stretched his long neck,
opened his mouth, and,
oh! such a queer noise!
It was a squeak and a
roar. I ran upstairs to
my sister. "It <em>is</em> a
rooster. Didn't you hear
'Chow-Chow' crow?"&mdash;"Do
you call that a crow? Why, I heard an awful noise, and wondered
what it was."</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[266]</a></span></p>

<p>But our chicken grew up one of the handsomest birds I ever saw.
And in a few weeks not a rooster in the neighborhood had such
a musical, splendid crow as our "Chow-Chow."</p>

<h2>HICKORY, DICKORY, DOCK!</h2>


<p><span class="smcap">Weezy</span> was so eager to help that she made it hard for herself and
for the family. She burned her fingers in stirring hot apple-sauce for
Bridget. She woke the baby in trying to curl the few hairs on
his little bald head. She
meddled with mamma's
knitting-work till she had
lost every needle. Papa
Haynes laughed at these
things; but when Weezy
learned to open his writing-desk
he looked grave.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 301px;">
<img src="images/illus018.jpg" width="301" height="500" alt="watching the clock" />
</div>

<p>"This'll never do," said
he to mamma. "The child
will be tearing my papers
next."</p>

<p>So he locked the desk,
and hung the key above
the tall clock beside it.</p>

<p>"There, my young squirrel,
you won't reach that
in a hurry," he said to
himself, kissing his little
daughter good-by.</p>

<p>After he was gone mamma
stepped into the kitchen
to tell Bridget about dinner.
Weezy stayed in the
sitting-room to sing Sambo
to sleep. Every time she
rocked back in her small
chair she could see the
key shining over the clock. It looked very much out of place.
She wondered why her papa had put it there. She wanted to whistle<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[269]</a></span>
with it. Oh hum! if she was a little speck of a bird she would fly
against it and brush it down with her wings. Or if Sambo was only
an angel! She danced across the floor, and threw him up as high as
she could. Instead of knocking down the key she knocked poor
Sambo's stocking-yarn head against the wall, and he fell flat upon the
top of the desk.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 400px;">
<img src="images/illus019.jpg" width="400" height="305" alt="Doll on table" />
</div>

<p>"Lie still, Sambo," cried Weezy, mounting a chair. From the
chair she easily climbed to the broad shelf of the desk. There she
rested a moment, leaning her chin on the top of the desk and patting
Sambo. But she did not take him in her arms, for not far above him
hung the key. She had set her little heart on getting it.</p>

<p>What do you think the little sprite did next? All by herself she
scrambled to the very top of that big desk. Standing on tiptoe, she
tried to reach over the clock! Even then she was not quite tall
enough to grasp the key with her chubby little fingers; but by perching
upon Sambo she got it at last.</p>

<p>By the time mamma came back Weezy had opened the desk, and
cut one of papa's deeds into paper dolls.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[270]</a></span></p>

<p>Papa was vexed enough, at noon, when he saw them.</p>

<p>"The loss of that deed will give me a great deal of trouble," said
he to mamma. "How <em>did</em> Weezy come by the key of my desk?"</p>

<div class='poem'>
"'Hickory, dickory, dock,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">The mouse ran up the clock!'"</span><br />
</div>

<div class='unindent'>answered mamma, laughing.</div>

<p>"Why, why, is it possible!" said papa, turning pale. "I'm thankful
she didn't break her neck,&mdash;our little mouse of a Weezy."</p>

<h2>A MEADOW SONG.</h2>


<div class='poem3'>
<span class="smcap">A little</span> daisy in a meadow grew,<br />
Kissed by the sunshine, and fed by the dew;<br />
And gayly she sang to the passers-by,<br />
"Was ever a daisy so happy as I?"<br />
<br />
Then the clover, hearing the daisy's voice,<br />
Began, in her own sweet way, to rejoice;<br />
And softly sang, to the prettiest tune,<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[271]</a></span>"What bliss to live and to grow in June!"<br />
<br />
The violet peeped from her mossy bed,<br />
And round her the sweetest fragrance shed,<br />
Till far and near, on the summer air,<br />
Floated the perfume, fresh and rare.<br />
</div>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 404px;">
<img src="images/illus021.jpg" width="404" height="500" alt="Girl with sheep" />
</div>

<div class='poem3'>
And the buttercup waked from a golden dream<br />
To join in the grateful and joyous theme,<br />
As daintily over the grass she stepped,<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[272]</a></span>The fresher and sweeter from having slept.<br />
<br />
The wild blue flag, with a laughing toss,<br />
Spanned her color the green across;<br />
"Ho! ho!" she cried. "Oh, how merry are we!"<br />
Skipping along in her flowery glee.<br />
<br />
The sweet-brier, growing beside the wall,<br />
Quickly blossomed to hear the call,<br />
And bent, with a gracious and royal mien,<br />
At the jubilant cries of "Our queen! our queen!"<br />
<br />
Then dandelion, golden head,<br />
To follow where the others led,<br />
Sung till the echoes, loud and long,<br />
Resounded with her joyous song.<br />
<br />
The cowslip rose, with a pleased surprise,<br />
And, donning a robe of gorgeous dyes,<br />
Sang in a voice so rich and sweet<br />
The concert now was quite complete.<br />
<br />
The meadow-lark, as he heard the song,<br />
Sprung from his nest to greet the throng;<br />
And, thrilled to his heart by the joyous lay,<br />
Flew, singing, aloft, in the merriest way.<br />
<br />
So, in the dewy meadow-grass,<br />
Where all may listen as they pass,<br />
Both bird and flower, in sweet attune,<br />
Make happier all the days of June.<br />

<img src="images/illus023.jpg" width="500" height="682" alt="OUR MOCKING BIRD title and decoration" />
</div>


<p><span class="smcap">A mocking-bird</span> made his home in a
honeysuckle in front of our cosey house.
In Arkansas,
where we
live, this sweet
shrub is evergreen.
Last
year the
honeysuckle
died, and
the bird
lost his
home; but he liked the place, and
he went with his family to the
lattice-room, in the rear of the
house.</p>

<p>In this apartment he found an
old travelling-bag, or gripsack,
hanging on a nail. Inside of it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[274]</a></span>
was an old soft hat. This seemed to be what the bird wanted, and
he made his nest in it. This was his home all winter, and he was
happy there. When the cold weather, which we sometimes have in
Arkansas, came, he went to the water bucket to drink, and we fed
him with crumbs from the porch.</p>

<p>We started the honeysuckle anew, and when it had climbed to the
top of the cedar pole it spread out its foliage like an umbrella. The
mocking-bird liked his old home, and he moved back to its branches
in the spring. He has a nice family in his nest, and they give us
music at all times, night and day.</p>

<p>The father bird was as brave as a soldier. His special aversion
is a large Newfoundland dog, who is one of our pets. The bird will
dart down upon the dog's back, and make war upon him with
a peculiar noise, until he drives him away. He does this because
he thinks the dog will hurt the young in the nest. When there are
no little ones he takes no notice of the dog.</p>

<p>We think this is a great deal better than keeping the birds in a
cage. They are tame, and stay with us all the time; but they will
not allow themselves to be caught.</p>

<h2>TROTTIE'S DOINGS.</h2>

<div class="figright" style="width: 226px;">

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Trottie</span> is a cunning little boy, not quite three years old. His
cradle is a little netted hammock. It is fastened at one end to his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[275]</a></span>
mamma's sewing-machine, and at
the other to a hook in the wall.
When Trottie grows tired he does
not trouble his mamma, but gets
into the little hammock and rocks
himself to sleep.</p>
<div class="figleft" style="width: 236px;">
<img src="images/illus025b.jpg" width="236" height="350" alt="Putting kittens into the churn" />
</div>
<p>One day the door-bell rang.
The little fellow picked up his
mother's best bonnet, which she
had placed upon the bed. Crushing
it down over his little golden
curly head he hastened to the door.</p>


<p>He found the minister there, a
tall, stately gentleman, wearing a
stove-pipe hat. Trottie's strange
appearance made the gentleman
laugh, and he asked, "Where are
you going, my little man?"</p>

<p>Trottie made no answer, but,
after a prolonged stare at the stove-pipe
hat, asked, "Are you Mr.
Yankee Doodle?" Mamma came
down just then. Laughing, she invited
the visitor in.</p>

<p>Not long afterwards Trottie
thought he would like to churn.
When his mother's back was
turned he put his two dear little
kittens, "Starry Eyes" and "Bluebell,"
into the churn, and poured a
cup of water over them. He was
just lifting the dasher when his
mother heard the kittens mewing
and took them out.</p>



<p>He loves the kittens dearly, and
would not hurt them for anything.</p>

<h2>THE PIGS' CHOWDER-PARTY.</h2>
<div><img src="images/illus028a.jpg" alt="top children in field" width="240" height="134" class="split" /></div>
<div><img src="images/illus028b.jpg" alt="top children in field" width="485" height="463" class="split" /></div>


<p><span class="smcap">Down</span> at Cape Cod there lived two merry little twin brothers.
Very full of fun and mischief were they, and seldom quiet except
when they were asleep.</p>


<p>One day their mamma bought
some clams. She was going to
have a chowder for supper. For
safe, cool keeping she put her
basket of clams on the grass,
under a great tree.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[279]</a></span></p>


<p>Johnnie and Willie
stood by, and heard
all that their mamma said
about it to auntie. They
just looked and heard it all.
Their baby faces&mdash;for they
were only a little over three
years old&mdash;were as solemn as
good old Deacon Pitts', who said he "didn't see why people laughed
when there was no occasion."</p>

<p>These two baby-rogues put their bits of plump little hands into the
pockets of their pretty white aprons. When mamma and auntie went
into the house Nurse Jane sat down on the piazza, knitting in hand,
to keep an eye on them. They began to play bo-peep behind the
lilac-bushes. When Nurse Jane dropped off to sleep, as she should
not have done, then it was that these two small men turned their
thoughts to other matters. First, there was a wild chase after butterflies.
Pretty soon they trotted down the walk to see Mistress Piggy
and her three lazy, grunting children. When the pigs heard voices
they, too, piped up, squealing out, as Johnnie afterwards told his
mamma, "Give <em>us</em> some! give <em>us</em> some!"</p>

<p>So at that call the laddies pelted Mistress Piggy and her children
with tufts of grass. Straying down the walk for more, they spied the
basket of clams. In a minute they were dragging the damp basket
over the grass, tugging away at the heavy load until their cheeks<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[280]</a></span>
were scarlet. Then such a pelting as Mistress Piggy and her family
had. But they were wild with the supper. They crunched and ate
until all the clams were gone. A pile of shells lay by the trough where
their food was usually put. "They had the chowder," Willie said.</p>

<p>Mamma and auntie had no chowder <em>that</em> night!</p>

<p>I do not know what mamma said to her small boys, but I do know
that they went very early to bed.</p>

<h2>PUSSY'S ADOPTED CHILDREN.</h2>


<div class="figleft" style="width: 271px;">
<img src="images/illus030.jpg" width="271" height="450" alt="Girl holding kitten while mamma cat watches" />
</div>
<p><span class="smcap">When</span> I was a little
girl I had a dear old pussy.
She was black and white,
handsome and dignified,
yet a grand playfellow
when she chose to put off
her dignity.</p>



<p>Great was my delight,
one lovely spring morning,
to find that pussy had
two beautiful little babies
in an old basket under the
shed steps. She was so
glad to have me see them,
and so proud of the little
soft, plump things, that
she purred her loudest.</p>

<p>For three weeks mamma,
kitty, and I nursed
those babies with increasing
pleasure. Whenever
she wanted to take the
air, or call on a friend, I
was always ready to sit
by the basket till she came
back.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[281]</a></span></p>

<p>One sad night Thomas Gray, an old enemy of pussy's, broke
into her house and killed both those darlings. Their mother
didn't shed a tear, but my tears fell fast. The little creatures had
just begun to be very cunning, and my disappointment was sore.</p>

<p>Over in the brick house across the street was another mamma
kitty, with five nice children. They were about the same age as
our kittens. Two were very like ours; so I got the idea of begging
for them, and giving them to my pussy. Away I ran to ask my
mamma's friend in the brick house if she would give me two of her
kittens. She laughed, and said, "I wish you would take them all."</p>

<p>I carried home the two I wanted, and gave them to our sad pussy
as she lay by the kitchen stove. At first she sniffed at them
eagerly, but they didn't smell one bit like her own sweet babies.
Then she was angry at the trick I seemed to be playing. Her
eyes looked fierce. She rose up, growled, and spit at the little
strangers, and tried to run away. But I held her while Mary, the
girl, brought some milk in a saucer. Kitty was hungry, and so
were the little ones; they tried to lap the milk with her, but
they could only wet their bits of noses, and nearly sneezed their
ears off.</p>

<p>Then they cried piteously, and looked at our pussy mother in
such an appealing way that it seemed to touch her. In a little
while she curled down on the floor and let them take her own
babies' places.</p>

<p>Presently she began to wash their little heads, and then to sing
"gray thrums" to them. At last she made up her mind that they
were very nice little things, and she would be a good mother to
them. And she was. Nobody would ever guess that they were
not her own children.</p>

Heard her gayly, sweetly speak<br />

Golden day from morn to even."<br />

Down I wander to the glen,<br />
Meeting whispers there again:<br />
Leaves that shake, and waves that whirl,<br />
Murmur of my birthday girl.<br />
Soft the leaves are, like her hair,<br />
And the brook-foam is as fair.<br />
Over me the sapphire skies<br />
Shine like her own gentle eyes.<br />
Break, O brook, in bubbling laughter!<br />
Only half you copy after<br />
Her who came with morning sun,&mdash;<br />
Her who now is "seven times one."<br />
<br />
Little morning-glory child,<br />
Bright as morn, as morning mild,<br />
Twine and wreathe thy fragile soul,&mdash;<br />
Delicate as the waves that roll<br />
Here in rainbows to my feet,&mdash;<br />
Twine and wreathe thee in our hearts,<br />
Sheltered be from storm and smarts;<br />
Cover us with dainty bloom;<br />
In our love find sunny room<br />
For thy dreams, songs, sallies mild,<br />
Blessed morning-glory child!<br />

<h2>WHAT KATY DID.</h2>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Katy-did-it!</span> Katy-did-it!"
sang the katy-dids
in the trees. Who was
Katy, and what did she
do, that all
night long the
insects sang
about her?</p>

<p>Who was
Katy? Why,
a pretty little
girl, six years
old. Such a
merry little
girl that every
one loved her.
Katy had come
out to stay
with Grandma
Lee. Mamma's
sister was
very sick, and
mamma had
gone to nurse
her. Papa sent
Katy and little
Tom, with
their nurse, to grandma's.</p>

<p>Grandma Lee lived in the country, in a large house, with a beautiful
garden to it. Back of the garden was the barn, where Katy liked
to hunt for eggs, and play in the hay. So Katy played from morning
till night at grandma's, and was very happy.</p>

<p>One warm afternoon she thought she would go into the parlor and
get a book that had beautiful pictures in it. It was on a table that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[285]</a></span>
had a scarf hanging over the edge. When Katy reached to get it
she pulled the table-scarf off. Down fell the book and a large vase,
which was broken all to pieces.</p>

<p>"Oh, dear!" said Katy, "grandma will be so angry. I am afraid
to tell her."</p>

<p>Little Tom had followed Katy in, and now stood beside her. Just
then Katy heard grandma coming, and ran out on the porch.</p>

<p>She heard grandma say, "You naughty boy, to break grandma's
pretty vase!"</p>


<p>Then Katy thought grandma will never know it was I who did it;
for Tom cannot talk, and he is always breaking things. I won't tell
her I did it. So she ran away,
and did not come in till grandma
called her. Then grandma told her
that Tom had gone into the parlor, and
had broken the vase by pulling the scarf off the table.</p>

<p>Katy did not say a word, but she could hardly eat her supper.
When little Tom came up to kiss her "Good-night," before nurse put<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[286]</a></span>
him to bed, she almost cried. But she thought it would not do to tell
then. She was glad when bed-time came, she felt so unhappy.</p>
<div class="figright" style="width: 500px;">
<img src="images/illus035.jpg" width="500" height="451" alt="In bed" />
</div>

<p>Katy slept in a little room that opened into grandma's. In the
middle of the night she heard a noise and waked up. The moon was
shining into the room, and it was almost as light as day. She heard
something which sounded like "Katy-did-it! Katy-did-it! Katy-did-it!"</p>

<p>She pulled the sheet over her head to shut out the noise; but still
she heard the singing, "Katy-did-it!"</p>

<p>"They mean me," said Katy. "I wish they would stop." But
they only sang the louder.</p>

<p>Katy could stand it no longer. She jumped out of bed and ran
into grandma's room, crying, "O grandma, grandma, Katy did it!"</p>

<p>Grandma jumped up, saying, "Why, child! what's the matter?"</p>

<p>"O grandma," sobbed Katy, "Tom did not do it; Katy did it."</p>

<p>"Did what?" asked grandma.</p>

<p>"I broke the vase," replied Katy, "and then let you think Tom did it."</p>

<p>Then Katy told grandma how the Katy-dids would not let her
sleep till she had told her all about it. Grandma said she hoped
Katy would never be afraid again to say "Katy did it," when she had
done wrong. I think, after that, she never was.</p>

1. "Dear little Fly-a-way, may I inquire,<br />
Whither so fast you are going?<br />
See not before you, the creek and the mire,<br />
What if the wind should stop blowing,<br />
You cannot curb in the windsteeds; and tho'<br />
Firm on their necks you're now lying,<br />
If they should pause once, away you would go<br />
Into the mud and lie dying.<br />

2. "Wee, winsome trouble-heart, can you not see,<br />
Home on these windsteeds I'm going?<br />
There to sleep sweetly, 'till Spring calls to me?<br />
Then a fair flow'r I'll be growing,<br />
Tho' but a weak little waif I appear,<br />
Purposes wise I'm fulfiling,<br />
Nothing that God rules is hopeless, my dear,<br />
Speed then winds, blow if you're willing.<br /><br /><br />

<div class='center'><b><span class='big'>A STRONG, SUBSTANTIAL ARTICLE.</span><br />


A STEM-WINDER.   &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;          CAN BE REGULATED PERFECTLY.   &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  RUNS FOR 28 HOURS.<br />
KEEPS IN ORDER WELL.</b></div>

<div class='cap'>This is the merchant's Watch, the farmer's Watch, the miner's Watch, the laborer's Watch, the boy's Watch, the school-girl's
Watch&mdash;in fact everybody's Watch. The Waterbury Watch Company has a national reputation for making the</div>

<div class='adtitle3'>Best Cheap Watch in the World.</div>

<p>THE WATERBURY WATCH is a stem-winder, and will run 28 hours. The case is Nickel-Silver, and will always remain
as bright as a new silver dollar. The Watch has a heavy beveled edge and crystal face. The works of the Watch are
made with the finest automatic machinery. Every Watch is tested in varying positions and is perfect before leaving the
factory. Every Watch is put up in a handsome new improved satin-lined case for safe transportation through the mails.</p>

<p>Teach your children to be on time. Give them a WATERBURY WATCH. No Boy or Girl should be without one.</p>

<p>So perfect is the machinery used in making this Watch, and so exact are all its parts, that if it needs repairs, if sent direct
to the factory, the charge for actual repairs (including parts used) never exceeds 50 cents. This will explain why they are
so cheap and so easily repaired.</p>

<div class='center'><b>A FEW TESTIMONIALS&mdash;THOUSANDS MORE COULD BE GIVEN.</b><br />

[From Thomas A. Edison, Electrician, New York, February 10, 1885.]</div>

<div class='blockquot'><p>"I have used the Waterbury Watch for some time and find that it is the only one which will keep reasonably perfect time
when used around powerful dynamo machines."</p>

<p>The New York <cite>Tribune</cite> says: "It is remarkable how quickly the Waterbury Watch has stepped into popular favor. No
doubt, the secret of its instant success has been the fact of its excellence. No amount of advertising could push into favor a
poor article. The Waterbury Watch is good and cheap."</p>

<p>"I have carried a Waterbury for over a year and find it a most excellent time-keeper. It has run beside a $100 gold watch
without showing the least variation."&mdash;F. G. PERRY, Wakefield, R. I.</p>

<p>"My Waterbury after three years' trial continues to give satisfaction, and is now going as good as when I received it. At
four o'clock daily we receive the time over our wire, and my watch is always prompt to the minute."&mdash;A. S. LETTS, Pennsylvania
Railroad, Jersey City.</p></div>

<div class='center'><b>By Neil Burgess.</b></div>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 210px;">
<img src="images/illus042a.jpg" width="210" height="200" alt="I" />
</div>

<div class='unindent'><br />T did my soul good," said
Mrs. Puffy, "to see old
Parson Wilder come in,
the dear old soul; he
looked as smiling as a
basket of chips, and it was
a nice morning, the sun
shining right into our setting-room;
and, as luck
would have it, I'd just
got all cleaned up and had
put on a clean calico and
white apron, and, if I do
say it, I looked as slick as
a whistle; and our garden&mdash;well, you'd oughter to seen it&mdash;a
mass of posies and blossoms everywhere; and as it
had rained in the night everything was as fresh as a
cowcumber. 'Well, well!' says the parson, 'this is a picture
one could never forget,' and he looked at my floor
and kitchen-table; they were both white as snow, and my
milk-pans&mdash;well you could just see your face in 'em, and
everything was as neat as a pink.</div>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 341px;">
<img src="images/illus042b.jpg" width="341" height="292" alt="Pastor sitting at Mrs. Puffy's table" />
</div>

<p>"I cut him a pie and got him a pitcher of milk, cause
I could see he was powerful hungry, and when he got
filled up he commenced: 'Cleanliness is next to Godliness;
now,' says he, 'what makes this home look so bright
and pure as the lily?' Says I 'It's Sapolio.'</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 332px;">
<img src="images/illus042c.jpg" width="332" height="258" alt="Mrs. Puffy explaining to the parson about Sapolio" />
</div>

<p>"'How?' says he, putting his hand to his ear, 'cause
he's a little deaf. 'Sapolio!' I yelled in his ear. 'No,' says
he, 'no; it's virtoo, moral virtoo, that's er shining through
it all,' and he kept that up till supper time, and stayed
and eat a big supper (I'm afraid they ain't er feeding the
old man as well up to his house as they oughter); and after
he had gone hum, I couldn't help thinking, as I looked at
my floor, table, pans and etceterer, that it may be moral
virtoo shining through 'em, <em>but it takes Sapolio to fetch
it out!</em>"</p>

<p><b>If your grocer does not keep Sapolio he can order it for
you from any wholesale grocer in the United States.</b></p>

<div class='adtitle2'>What is Sapolio?</div>

<p>It is a solid, handsome cake of scouring soap, which has
no equal for all cleaning purposes, except the laundry.</p>

<p>What will Sapolio do? Why, it will clean paint, make
oil cloths bright. You can scour the knives and forks with
it, and make the tin things shine brightly.</p>

<p>The wash basin, the bath tub, even the greasy kitchen
sink, will be as clean as a new pin if you use SAPOLIO.</p>

<div class='big'><p>For washing the hair only the very best soap and pure water should
be used.</p>

<p>The average soap contains too much free alkali, which draws the natural
oil from the hair and scalp, and leaves the former dry and lusterless
while it roughens the latter, causing scurf or dandruff.</p>

<p>The purity and mildness of the Ivory Soap gives it pre-eminence
for cleaning the hair and scalp. It contains no free alkali, so its use insures
a clean and healthy head of hair of the luster and softness of silk.</p></div>

If your grocer does not keep the Ivory Soap, send six two-cent stamps, to pay the postage,<br />
to Procter &amp; Gamble, Cincinnati, and they will send you <em>free</em> a large cake of <span class="smcap">Ivory Soap</span>.</div>

HIS OPINION OF PEARS' SOAP</div>

<div class='blockquot'><p>If Cleanliness is next to Godliness,
Soap must be considered as
a Means of Grace and a
Clergyman who recommends
moral things should be willing
to recommend Soap. I am
told that my commendation of
Pears' Soap has opened for it
a large sale in the United States.
I am willing to stand by every word in
favor of it that I ever uttered. A man
must be fastidious indeed who is not
satisfied with it.</p>

As recommended by the greatest English authority
on the Skin,<br />

<p>Nothing adds so much to personal appearance as a <b>Bright, Clear Complexion
and a Soft Skin</b>. With these the plainest features become attractive.
Without them the handsomest are but coldly impressive.</p>

<p><em>Many a complexion is marred by impure alkaline and Colored Toilet Soap.</em></p>

<div class='center'>PEARS' SOAP</div>

<p>Is specially prepared for the delicate skin of ladies and children and others sensitive to
the weather, winter or summer. In England it is pre-eminently the complexion Soap,
and is recommended by all the best authorities, as, on account of its emollient, non-irritant
character, <b>Redness, Roughness and Chapping are prevented,
and a clear and bright appearance and a soft, velvety
condition imparted and maintained, and a good, healthful
and attractive complexion ensured</b>.</p>

<p>Its agreeable and lasting perfume, beautiful appearance, and soothing properties
commend it as the greatest luxury of the toilet. Its durability and consequent economy
is remarkable.</p>
